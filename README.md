# ManagingVirtualCommunities

A java application using JaCaMo framework to allow agents to interact using virtual communities. In this project the user should sign up to create an account and to assign an agent whihc will help him in doing some tasks.

## Types of virtual communities
In this project, we have two types of virtual communities:
* Information sharing (Messaging): The subscribers of this community are able to send and receive messages between each others.
* Voting: The subscribers of this community are able to vote for a specific poll realted to a specific topic provided by the creator of the community.

## Tasks of the agent
Each person has his own agent that is capable of doing these tasks:
* Enter a virtual community
* Exit a virtual community
* In case the community is of type "Voting", the agent can display, send, and receive messages.
* In case the community is of type "Voting" the agent can vote for the selected value.
